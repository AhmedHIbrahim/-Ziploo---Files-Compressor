## Ziploo Compressing Bash program 


This tiny linux-cli-dialog program uses two linux functions to compress and uncompress (gzip & bzip2).To have a successful compressing mission please, follow the  following instructions.
1. Choose a file without its absolute path e.g {{/home/$whoami/Pictures}} just write "Pictures" and remove the other things in the inbox. 
2. To compress multiple files , please compine them in one folder and compress it. 
3. The uncompressing mission will save the content in a "ziploo" folder in your home directory.
