Ziploo Compressing program


This tiny program uses two functions to compress and uncompress (gzip & bzip2).To have a successful compressing mission please, follow the  following instructions.1))-Choose a file without its absolute path e.g {{/home/$whoami/Pictures}} just write "Pictures" and remove the other things in the inbox. 2))-To compress multiple files , please compine them in one folder and compress it. 3))-The uncompressing mission will save the content in a "ziploo" folder in your home directory ,Thanks for your understanding
